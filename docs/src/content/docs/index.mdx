import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Why?
* Storing secrets necessary to send emails  in many projects is tedious, it is easier to centralize that secret access.
* Sending emails in apps often involves setting up some sort of messaging queue and templating engine to handle
variables in emails. Doing this for every app is again, tedious.
* Centralizing email templates gives transparency of what exists already.
* Removing vendor lock-in from email SaaS products is ideal. Switching between Mailgun, Sendgrid, Mandrill, etc...
