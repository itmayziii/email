## Why?
* Storing secrets necessary to send emails  in many projects is tedious, it is easier to centralize that secret access.
* Sending emails in apps often involves setting up some sort of messaging queue and templating engine to handle
variables in emails. Doing this for every app is again, tedious.
* Centralizing email templates gives transparency of what exists already.
* Removing vendor lock-in from email SaaS products is ideal. Switching between Mailgun, Sendgrid, Mandrill, etc...

## Features
This package is designed to facilitate email sending in a vendor-neutral manner, avoiding any vendor lock-in.
We achieve this goal through the following features:

* ### Sending Options:
  * Providing users with the flexibility to choose their preferred method of sending emails, whether it's through a SaaS
    solution like [Mailgun][mailgun] or [SendGrid][sendgrid], or by utilizing their own SMTP server.

* ### Template Storage:
  * Allowing users to decide where they want to store email templates, whether it's on their local disk or in cloud
    storage services like [S3][s3] or [Google Cloud Storage (GCS).][gcs]

* ### Standardization
  * Adhering to the [CloudEvent specification][cloud-events] to ensure a consistent and opinionated structure for event
    data.
